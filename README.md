# EventPlanner24 University Team Project

This webapp is the result of a team project at university. We were tasked to create a simple event planner app,
which included features such as events with a name, begin date, guest list, seating plan and more.

As the requirements were quite strict, and we had to build an SPA without using a frontend framework such as Svelte(Kit) or
React (with Next.js) which come with their own built-in routing solution, I had to resort to building an own little "framework"
and router. All html/ejs files are bundled into a single file, generated by a script, and then dynamically routed to by
a simple javascript router.

## Build

After cloning the repository, run
```shell
npm i && npm run build && npm start
```
to build the frontend and start the backend on `localhost:8080`.

The resulting webapp can also be seen at [event-planner.moritz.website](https://event-planner.moritz.website).
